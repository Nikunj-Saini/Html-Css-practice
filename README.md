# HTML & CSS Practice Projects

Welcome to my front-end playground.  
This repository contains a growing collection of pure HTML and CSS projects to practice, experiment, and build clean UI components.  
No frameworks, no JavaScript — just raw, responsive, and reusable design blocks.

## Why this repo?

Sometimes, the best way to learn is by doing — this repo is my journey of mastering front-end fundamentals by building small, meaningful HTML/CSS projects.

You’ll find:
- Custom buttons and forms  
- Image styling layouts  
- Search box UI  
- Typography experiments  
…and more coming soon.
